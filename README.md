# RVM (Ricky's VM)

This is a small custom virtual machine with a RISC-V like instruction set. This was mainly created with the purpose to learning about virtual machines and low-level design.

### In progress
- Currently finishing up an assembler
- Creating a compiler for a custom esoteric language so we can have a fully functional "environment" with a VM + assembler + compiler + language.
